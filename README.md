# situational-awareness v2

Performs network discovery by identifying:

domain name<br>
domain controllers<br>
dns servers<br>
external ip<br>
internal ip<br>
network address<br>
subnet mask<br>
network cidr<br>
gateway<br>
file shares<br>
hosts<br>

Thanks to Brennon Stovall for adding the network address functionality and making a couple of the functions more efficient.
